    "We've been working with different types of data structures in Python (dictionary, list, etc), how those are represented in JSON documents, and how to write code to access specific data elements. In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",
